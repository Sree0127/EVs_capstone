# Exploratory Data Analysis of Electric Vehicles in Washington State

Motivation:

The increasing adoption of electric vehicles in Washington State aligns with the global shift towards sustainable transportation. This project aims to analyze distribution patterns and growth trends of EVs across diverse regions to inform stakeholders, policymakers, and the public about the ongoing transition towards cleaner transportation alternatives.

Our project centers on conducting an extensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends. We intend to investigate several pivotal areas of interest:

Evolution of EV Distribution Across Counties:
Explore the evolution of electric vehicle distribution across diverse counties in Washington State over recent years.

Factors Influencing EV Adoption and Growth:
Examine the factors that significantly influence the adoption and growth of EVs within these regions.

Geographical Distribution by Make and Model:
Analyze the geographic distribution of vehicles based on their make and model, mapping their spatial presence across the region.

Project Overview:

Our project focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends. We aim to explore several key areas of interest:

1.	How has the distribution of electric vehicles evolved across various counties in Washington State over recent years?
2.	What factors influence the adoption and growth of EVs in these regions?
3.	How are vehicles distributed geographically based on their make and model?
