# Exploratory Data Analysis of Electric Vehicles in Washington State

Motivation

The increasing adoption of electric vehicles in Washington State aligns with the global shift towards sustainable transportation. This project aims to analyze distribution patterns and growth trends of EVs across diverse regions to inform stakeholders, policymakers, and the public about the ongoing transition towards cleaner transportation alternatives.

Data Questions:

1.	How has the distribution of electric vehicles evolved across various counties in Washington State over recent years?
2.	What factors influence the adoption and growth of EVs in these regions?
3.	What variations exist in registration transactions among different types of electric vehicles?

The MVP includes an interactive visualization dashboard with the following features:

-Interactive map showcasing spatial distribution of EVs across counties.
-Graphical representations of EV density within cities or specific regions.
-Time-series charts illustrating EV registrations' evolution in selected areas.
-Graphs depicting trends in EV model years.
-Visualizations exploring relationships between CAFV eligibility, electric range, and MSRP against EV prevalence.

Data Sources:

•	Electric Vehicle Population Dataset: 
•	Source: Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL)
•	Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data
•	File Type: .csv
•	Electric Vehicle Title and Registration Activity Dataset
•	Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-title-and-registration-activity
•	File Type: .csv

Challenges:

•	Data Integrity: Addressing missing or incomplete fields within both datasets.
•	Data Compatibility and Integration: Ensuring seamless merging of the datasets based on common   identifiers (e.g., VIN).
•	Visualization Complexity: Designing clear and insightful visualizations to effectively convey findings from the data.
